    In this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns
    attacking. The player always goes first. Each attack reduces the opponent's
    hit points by at least 1. The first character at or below 0 hit points
    loses.

    Damage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's damage
    score minus the defender's armor score. An attacker always does at least 1
    damage. So, if the attacker has a damage score of 8, and the defender has an
    armor score of 3, the defender loses 5 hit points. If the defender had an
    armor score of 300, the defender would still lose 1 hit point.

    Your damage score and armor score both start at zero. They can be increased
    by buying items in exchange for gold. You start with no items and have as
    much gold as you need. Your total damage or armor is equal to the sum of
    those stats from all of your items. You have 100 hit points.

    Here is what the item shop is selling:

    Weapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor
    Dagger        8     4       0
    Shortsword   10     5       0
    Warhammer    25     6       0
    Longsword    40     7       0
    Greataxe     74     8       0

    Armor:      Cost  Damage  Armor
    Leather      13     0       1
    Chainmail    31     0       2
    Splintmail   53     0       3
    Bandedmail   75     0       4
    Platemail   102     0       5

    Rings:      Cost  Damage  Armor
    Damage +1    25     1       0
    Damage +2    50     2       0
    Damage +3   100     3       0
    Defense +1   20     0       1
    Defense +2   40     0       2
    Defense +3   80     0       3

    You must buy exactly one weapon; no dual-wielding. Armor is optional, but
    you can't use more than one. You can buy 0-2 rings (at most one for each
    hand). You must use any items you buy. The shop only has one of each item,
    so you can't buy, for example, two rings of Damage +3.

    You have 100 hit points. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input.
