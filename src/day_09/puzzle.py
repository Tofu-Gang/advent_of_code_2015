--- Day 9: All in a Single Night ---

Every year, Santa manages to deliver all of his presents in a single night.

This year, however, he has some new locations to visit; his elves have provided 
him the distances between every pair of locations. He can start and end at any 
two (different) locations he wants, but he must visit each location exactly 
once.
