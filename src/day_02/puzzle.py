--- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---

The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order 
for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) 
of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so they 
only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they would again 
like to be exact.
