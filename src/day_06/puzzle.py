--- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---
Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating
contest year after year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a
1000x1000 grid.

Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you
instructions on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.
