--- Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph ---

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, 
and he needs medicine.

Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is 
going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry 
isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.

The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission 
plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It 
works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of 
replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.
