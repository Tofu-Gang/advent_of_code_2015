--- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't
find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts
on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at
a time.

An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing
parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will
never find the top or bottom floors.
