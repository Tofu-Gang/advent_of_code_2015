--- Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---

Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.

The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a robot version of 
himself, Robo-Santa, to deliver presents with him.

    Santa begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location,
