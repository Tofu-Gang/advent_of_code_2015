--- Day 14: Reindeer Olympics ---

This year is the Reindeer Olympics! Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must
rest occasionally to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of his
reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.

    Seeing how reindeer move in bursts, Santa decides he's not pleased with the
    old scoring system.

    Instead, at the end of each second, he awards one point to the reindeer
    currently in the lead. (If there are multiple reindeer tied for the lead,
    they each get one point.) He keeps the traditional 2503 second time limit,
