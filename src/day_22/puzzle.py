    In this version, combat still proceeds with the player and the boss taking
    alternating turns. The player still goes first. Now, however, you don't get
    any equipment; instead, you must choose one of your spells to cast. The
    first character at or below 0 hit points loses.

    Since you're a wizard, you don't get to wear armor, and you can't attack
    normally. However, since you do magic damage, your opponent's armor is
    ignored, and so the boss effectively has zero armor as well. As before, if
    armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below 1, it becomes 1
    instead - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least 1 damage.

    On each of your turns, you must select one of your spells to cast. If you
    cannot afford to cast any spell, you lose. Spells cost mana; you start with
    500 mana, but have no maximum limit. You must have enough mana to cast a
    spell, and its cost is immediately deducted when you cast it. Your spells
    are Magic Missile, Drain, Shield, Poison, and Recharge.

    -Magic Missile costs 53 mana. It instantly does 4 damage.
    -Drain costs 73 mana. It instantly does 2 damage and heals you for 2 hit
     points.
    -Shield costs 113 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. While it
     is active, your armor is increased by 7.
    -Poison costs 173 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. At the
     start of each turn while it is active, it deals the boss 3 damage.
    -Recharge costs 229 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 5 turns. At the
     start of each turn while it is active, it gives you 101 new mana.

    Effects all work the same way. Effects apply at the start of both the
    player's turns and the boss' turns. Effects are created with a timer (the
    number of turns they last); at the start of each turn, after they apply any
    effect they have, their timer is decreased by one. If this decreases the
    timer to zero, the effect ends. You cannot cast a spell that would start an
    effect which is already active. However, effects can be started on the same
    turn they end.

    You start with 50 hit points and 500 mana points. The boss's actual stats
    are in your puzzle input. What is the least amount of mana you can spend and
    still win the fight? (Do not include mana recharge effects as "spending"
    negative mana.)
