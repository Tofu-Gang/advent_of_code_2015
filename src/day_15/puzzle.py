--- Day 15: Science for Hungry People ---

Today, you set out on the task of perfecting your milk-dunking cookie recipe.
All you have to do is find the right balance of ingredients.

    Your recipe leaves room for exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients. You make a
    list of the remaining ingredients you could use to finish the recipe (the
    puzzle input) and their properties per teaspoon:

    -capacity (how well it helps the cookie absorb milk)
    -durability (how well it keeps the cookie intact when full of milk)
    -flavor (how tasty it makes the cookie)
    -texture (how it improves the feel of the cookie)
    -calories (how many calories it adds to the cookie)

    You can only measure ingredients in whole-teaspoon amounts accurately, and
    you have to be accurate so you can reproduce your results in the future. The
    total score of a cookie can be found by adding up each of the properties
    (negative totals become 0) and then multiplying together everything except
    calories.

    Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the
    total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?
